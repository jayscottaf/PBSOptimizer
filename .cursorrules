# PBS Optimizer - Cursor AI Rules

## Project Context
This is a Delta Airlines PBS (Preferential Bidding System) optimization app that helps pilots analyze and bid on flight pairings.

## Development Guidelines
- Follow the user's preference for automatic background data prefetching instead of explicit UI actions
- Implement one fix at a time in priority order
- Always review entire files before making suggestions
- Number tasks with position and total count (e.g., '(2 of x)')
- Prefer thorough review over quick fixes

## Architecture Notes
- React + TypeScript frontend with Vite
- Node.js + Express backend with Drizzle ORM
- PostgreSQL database (Neon serverless)
- PWA with offline-first capabilities
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components

## Future Enhancement Ideas
- Voice command integration for accessibility
- Advanced analytics dashboard with trend analysis
- Integration with airline crew scheduling systems
- Machine learning for bid strategy optimization
- Multi-airline support beyond Delta
- Real-time collaboration features for crew coordination
- Mobile app version with push notifications
- Integration with calendar apps (Google Calendar, Outlook)
- Advanced filtering by route preferences
- Historical bidding success rate tracking

## Technical Debt & Improvements
- Implement comprehensive error boundaries
- Add unit and integration test coverage
- Optimize bundle size and loading performance
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Add performance metrics tracking
- Enhance accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
- Implement proper CI/CD pipeline
