# Delta PBS Bid Optimization App

## Overview

The Delta PBS Bid Optimization App is a full-stack web application designed for Delta pilots to parse monthly bid packages, store pairing data, track historical bid awards, and predict hold likelihood. The application processes PDF bid packages, extracts detailed pairing information, and provides analytics to help pilots make informed bidding decisions.

## Data Flow

1. **PDF Upload**: Pilots upload monthly bid packages through the file upload component
2. **Processing Pipeline**: Server extracts text, parses structured data, and stores in database
3. **Search Interface**: Real-time filtering and search across pairing data
4. **Detail Views**: Modal dialogs showing complete pairing information and history
5. **Analytics**: Historical data analysis for seniority trends and hold predictions

The application follows a monorepo structure with shared TypeScript types between frontend and backend, ensuring type safety across the entire stack. The architecture prioritizes developer experience with hot reloading, comprehensive error handling, and a modern TypeScript-first approach.

## Recent Changes

**July 18, 2025**: Fixed Critical AI Assistant and Database Route Issues

**AI Assistant Pairing Lookup**: Resolved specific pairing number queries (e.g., "show me pairing 7758")
- Fixed `getPairingByNumber` database function to properly chain WHERE conditions using `and()` operator
- Pairing lookups now return correct specific pairing data instead of random pairings

**Database Route Field Completion**: Enhanced route generation to show complete journey paths
- **Before**: Routes missing return segments (e.g., `JFK-MSP-CMH-MKE-SLC-SBA-ATL`)
- **After**: Complete roundtrip routes (e.g., `JFK-MSP-CMH-MSP-MKE-SLC-SBA-ATL-JFK`)
- Applied enhanced `parseRoute` function with chronological ordering to all 534 pairings
- Routes now accurately reflect full pilot journey including intermediate returns

**Production Impact**: AI assistant now provides accurate specific pairing analysis with correct route information
