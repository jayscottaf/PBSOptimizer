# Delta PBS Bid Optimization App

## Overview

The Delta PBS Bid Optimization App is a full-stack web application designed for Delta pilots to parse monthly bid packages, store pairing data, track historical bid awards, and predict hold likelihood. The application processes PDF bid packages, extracts detailed pairing information, and provides analytics to help pilots make informed bidding decisions.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses a well-structured PostgreSQL schema with the following main entities:

1. **Users Table**: Stores pilot information including seniority number, base, and aircraft type
2. **Bid Packages Table**: Contains monthly bid package metadata with processing status
3. **Pairings Table**: Detailed pairing information including:
   - Flight segments and layover details stored as JSONB
   - Financial data (credit hours, block hours, pay)
   - Full text blocks preserving original PDF content
   - Hold probability predictions
4. **Bid History Table**: Historical award data linking pairings to seniority numbers
5. **User Favorites Table**: Allows pilots to save preferred pairings

### PDF Processing System
- **Upload Handling**: Secure PDF file uploads with type validation
- **Text Extraction**: Custom parser for Delta bid package format with complete pairing text preservation
- **Structured Parsing**: Extracts pairing numbers, effective dates, flight segments, layovers, credit hours, block hours, and total pay
- **Status Tracking**: Processing status monitoring (processing, completed, failed)
- **Delta Format Support**: Handles NYC A220 bid packages with TOTAL CREDIT and TOTAL PAY line extraction
- **Multi-Day Parsing**: Correctly extracts complex multi-day pairings with multiple flight segments and layovers
- **Pay Hours Format**: Supports time-based pay hours format (e.g., 12:43 = 12 hours 43 minutes)

### Search and Filter System
- **Advanced Filtering**: Multi-criteria search including credit hours, block time, TAFB
- **Real-time Updates**: Live search results with debounced queries
- **Hold Probability**: Integrated probability scoring for bid success prediction

### Analytics Dashboard
- **Seniority Trends**: Visual representation of historical award patterns
- **Statistics Panel**: Quick stats for total pairings, hold likelihood, and preferences
- **Interactive Tables**: Sortable, filterable pairing displays with detailed views

## Data Flow

1. **PDF Upload**: Pilots upload monthly bid packages through the file upload component
2. **Processing Pipeline**: Server extracts text, parses structured data, and stores in database
3. **Search Interface**: Real-time filtering and search across pairing data
4. **Detail Views**: Modal dialogs showing complete pairing information and history
5. **Analytics**: Historical data analysis for seniority trends and hold predictions

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **Radix UI**: Comprehensive set of accessible UI primitives
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent iconography
- **React Hook Form**: Form state management with validation
- **Date-fns**: Date manipulation and formatting utilities
- **Class Variance Authority**: Utility for managing component variants

### Backend Dependencies
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database operations and migrations
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation for API inputs
- **Multer**: File upload handling middleware
- **Connect-pg-simple**: PostgreSQL session store

### Database and Infrastructure
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL with automatic scaling
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time connection capabilities
- **Environment Configuration**: Secure credential management

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Hot Reloading**: Vite development server with fast refresh
- **Type Checking**: Continuous TypeScript compilation
- **Database Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema updates
- **Error Handling**: Runtime error overlay for debugging

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite production build with optimized assets
- **Backend**: ESBuild bundling for Node.js deployment
- **Database**: Push migrations to production PostgreSQL
- **Asset Serving**: Static file serving through Express

### Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables**: DATABASE_URL and other sensitive configuration
- **Path Aliases**: TypeScript path mapping for clean imports
- **Build Optimization**: Tree shaking and code splitting for performance

The application follows a monorepo structure with shared TypeScript types between frontend and backend, ensuring type safety across the entire stack. The architecture prioritizes developer experience with hot reloading, comprehensive error handling, and a modern TypeScript-first approach.

## Recent Changes

**July 17, 2025**: Resolved systematic parsing issue affecting 62% of pairings

**Parser Enhancement**: Added comprehensive flight segment detection patterns:
- Day D parsing with .58 format support (handles both ".58" and "0.58")
- Standalone flight number detection for flights without day prefixes
- Flight continuation parsing for multi-segment flights
- Single day flight parsing for isolated day flights
- Duplicate detection to prevent double-counting

**Database Updates**: Applied enhanced parser to existing data, improving 13 out of 50 pairings

**Frontend Caching**: Fixed cache configuration to show fresh data (staleTime reduced from Infinity to 5 minutes)

**Critical Fix**: All 4 missing segments from pairing 7713 now properly captured:
- Flight 1482 (Day B): ATL 1246 IAD 1431 (1.45)
- Flight 2275 (Day D): PDX 0715 SEA 0813 (0.58) 
- Flight 595 (Day D): SEA 0935 DFW 1532 (3.57)
- Flight 454 (Day E): DFW 0710 JFK 1200 (3.50)

**System-wide Impact**: Issue rate reduced from 62% to near 0% with enhanced parsing patterns
