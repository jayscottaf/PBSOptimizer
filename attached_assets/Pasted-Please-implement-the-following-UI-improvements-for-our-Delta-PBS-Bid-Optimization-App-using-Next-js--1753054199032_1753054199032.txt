Please implement the following UI improvements for our Delta PBS Bid Optimization App using Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components:

Overall Layout & Structure:

Refactor the main content area to create a responsive grid layout.
On larger screens, position the left column with "Upload Bid Package", "Your Info", and "Quick Stats" sections, while the right column should contain the "Pairing Analysis".
On smaller screens, ensure these sections stack properly.
Enclose each distinct section (e.g., "Upload Bid Package", "Your Info", "Quick Stats", "Pairing Analysis") within Card components from shadcn/ui.
Header:

Modernize the header to include the app title ("Delta PBS Optimizer"), navigation links ("Bid Analysis", "History", "Predictions"), and user information ("Seniority: #15860 | NYC A220 FO").
Use action icons (Refresh, Delete, Settings, User) utilizing lucide-react for all icons.
Main Content Area (Right Column):

Implement a Tabs component for navigation with tabs labeled "Search & Filter", "Analysis", and "AI Assistant".
Each tab should have the following components:
"Search & Filter" Tab:
Add a search input field with a Search icon.
Display active filters using Badge components, featuring an X icon for removal.
Implement Select components for the filter dropdowns ("Credit Range", "Block Time", "TAFB", "Hold Probability").
Create an empty state for "No Bid Package Ready" with an appropriate icon and message.
"Analysis" Tab:
Create an empty state indicating "No Data for Analysis" with a relevant icon and guiding text.
"AI Assistant" Tab:
Create an empty state indicating "AI Assistant Not Active" with a relevant icon and guiding text.
Left Column Sections:

"Upload Bid Package" Card:
Design a drag-and-drop area with a CloudUpload icon, and provide informative text about supported file types.
"Your Info" Card:
Utilize Input components for "Seniority Number" and Select components for "Base" and "Aircraft".
"Quick Stats" Card:
Present stats (Total Pairings, Likely to Hold, High Credit, 6-Day Combos) in a two-column layout.
General Enhancements:

Ensure all interactive elements are styled consistently using shadcn/ui.
Maintain modern aesthetics and appropriate spacing/typography.
Organize the code effectively into logical components, integrating the primary component into app/page.tsx.
