### Logic for Hold Probability Categories

Use the following rules to define **hold probability ranges** for each pairing.

#### ðŸ”µ HIGH HOLD PROBABILITY (User Likely to Hold the Trip)
A trip is considered **likely to be held** (high probability = 80â€“100%) when:
- It has **low to moderate desirability** (e.g. short credit, high block time, no deadheads)
- It appears **frequently** in the bid package
- It **starts on a Saturday** or ends on a Sunday (less desirable days)
- It does **not** include weekends off or long layovers
- It has **no or few deadhead legs**

#### ðŸŸ  MEDIUM HOLD PROBABILITY (Could Go Either Way)
A trip falls into **medium probability** (50â€“80%) when:
- It has **average credit and block**
- It has **moderate desirability** (e.g. a deadhead but moderate TAFB or credit)
- Itâ€™s **not rare**, but not overly common either
- It includes **somewhat desirable days** (e.g. midweek start with one weekend day)

#### ðŸ”´ LOW HOLD PROBABILITY (Unlikely to Hold)
A trip is considered **low probability** (0â€“50%) when:
- It has **high desirability** (e.g. high credit, low block, multiple deadheads, long layovers, weekends off)
- It is **rare** in the bid package (only 1â€“2 instances)
- It starts on **Monday or Thursday** and finishes before the weekend
- It includes **multiple deadhead legs**
- Itâ€™s known to be **popular with senior bidders**

### Logic Integration

Use this logic in a `getHoldProbability()` function that takes:
- `seniorityPercentile: number` (0â€“100)
- `desirabilityScore: number` (0â€“100)
- `pairingFrequency: number` (number of instances in the bid package)
- `startsOnWeekend: boolean`
- `includesDeadheads: number`
- `includesWeekendOff: boolean`

Return an estimated **hold probability (0â€“100%)** using conditional logic.

Make sure to:
- Cap probabilities to the expected ranges defined above.
- Use some randomness (+/â€“ 5%) for realism if desired.
- Document why a trip was scored high, medium, or low (for debugging and transparency in UI).
