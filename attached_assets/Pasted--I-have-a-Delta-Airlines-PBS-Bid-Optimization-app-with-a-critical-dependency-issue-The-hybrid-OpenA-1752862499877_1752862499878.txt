"I have a Delta Airlines PBS Bid Optimization app with a critical dependency issue. The hybrid OpenAI service keeps failing with this error:

Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package 'fast-safe-stringify' imported from /home/runner/workspace/server/openaiHybrid.ts
Current State:

The app is running on Node.js with TypeScript (using tsx)
Package.json shows the app uses ES modules ("type": "module")
The hybrid service imports: import safeStringify from 'fast-safe-stringify';
Both fast-safe-stringify and tiktoken packages were recently installed
The error persists and causes fallback to basic assistant (no access to actual pairing data)
534 pairings in the database but users only get generic responses
Files to examine:

server/openaiHybrid.ts - Contains the failing import
package.json - Check if packages are properly listed
server/routes.ts - Shows the fallback logic when hybrid service fails
What I need you to do:

Verify package installation: Check if fast-safe-stringify and tiktoken are actually in package.json dependencies
Fix import syntax: The import might be incorrect for ES modules - check if it should be import * as safeStringify or import { stringify as safeStringify }
Install missing dependencies: If packages aren't in package.json, install them properly
Test the fix: Ensure the hybrid service can start without import errors
Verify functionality: Make sure the AI assistant can access real pairing data instead of falling back to basic responses
Expected outcome:

No more 'ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND' errors in console
Hybrid OpenAI service works properly
AI assistant returns actual pairing numbers and data from the 534 pairings
Users get detailed responses with real credit hours, block times, and pairing analysis
Test case:
Ask the AI assistant: 'Show me 4-day pairings with credit-to-block ratios above 1.2' and verify it returns actual pairing numbers (not generic responses).

Please provide the exact steps and code changes needed to resolve this dependency issue."
